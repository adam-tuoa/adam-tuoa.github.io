title: "About me"
---

I am a Melbourne-based data specialist, with a vast and unique background in the creative industries as performer, composer, sculptor, educator, director, advocate, editor and consultant. Key to my successes have been my creative thinking, ability to adapt, willingness to learn and enjoyment of a job well done.

As a leader and promoter of my own ensembles, instigator of major events and co-founder/editor of a national magazine, I have come to understand my capacity to create something impactful because of the creative perspective, dedication and enthusiasm I bring to each project.

Below are examples of some of the arts-related projects that have developed skills that have more recently seen me successfully build a data pipeline for extracting, cleaning and analysing retail sales and customer data, as well as contribute data solutions to projects in health, education and public legislation, and complete my graduate certificate studies with distinction.

### Stakeholder Engagement

- Initiated the online Australian Jazz Forum 2020, to consult the national community to inform a parliamentary inquiry submission on Australia's creative industries. The result was over 80 participants representing artists, venues, organisations, education institutions, media and festivals. Collaboration was encouraged throuhgout and the final submission shared with all and made public.
- At Wangaratta Festival of Jazz & Blues, I reported directly to the board, worked with event management team, represented the artistic panel, engaged with sponsors, venue owners, accommodation, tourism, funding partners, artists, volunteers and audiences - the result was a re-invigoration of the festival community spirit, new sponsors and positive critical reviews.
