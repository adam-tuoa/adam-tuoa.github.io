title: "Power BI - Student Performance"

December 5, 2024

An interview task to create a interactive Power BI dashboard for high-level insights from a sample of student performance data.

1. Student participation in Victoria against other states and Australia overall<br>
2. Student achievement for Numeracy, Reading, and Writing by year level in Victoria<br>
3. Student achievement for Numeracy, Reading, and Writing by student attribute in Victoria<br>

I added the scatterplots in, as it was from these that the deep insights emerged, bringing tears to my eyes as I saw the impacts of demographic differences in the charts.

This dashboard taught me a lot - and secured me a job.
