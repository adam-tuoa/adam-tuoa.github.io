Considering why Python has become the worldâ€™s most popular programming language - this storytelling project required use of PowerPoint, including techniques such as animation, transitions and recording of the presentation itself. 

For this RMIT Data Visualisation initial assignment, we had to use public data visualisations to tell a story of insights. I thought I might look at comparing Python and R as a way to learn more about their relationship, when I found [PYPL (PopularitY of Python Language Index)](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html){target="_blank"}. While it was interesting to learn just how different the stories of the two programming languages are, it was particularly Python's period of strong growth over the past decade that I thought would be interesting to explore in more detail.

I may or may not have deduced all of the contributing factors for Python's ascendancy, but aside from developing presentation skills, it was a great project for learning to look outward from the immediate data to help understand what insights might be gained.
