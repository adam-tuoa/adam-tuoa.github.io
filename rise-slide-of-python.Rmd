Considering why Python has become the worldâ€™s most popular programming language - this storytelling project required use of PowerPoint, including techniques such as animation, transitions and recording of the presentation itself. 

For this RMIT Data Visualisation initial assignment, we had to use public data visualisations to tell a story of insights. I thought I might look at comparing Python and R as a way to learn more about their relationship, when I found [PYPL (PopularitY of Python Language Index)](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html){target="_blank"}. While it was interesting to learn just how different the stories of the two programming languages are, it was particularly Python's period of strong growth over the past decade that I thought would be interesting to explore in more detail.

This project seriously helped up my game with PowerPoint, which until this point I had considered as a static slideshow only and a dumbed down version of Indesign (partly due to my KPMG experience). Learning about the flexibility and ease of adding animations, transitions and recording helped open up different creative possibilities.

One problem I discovered during the recording process was that certain slide transitions pause the audio recording until finished - I had been trying to flow across transitions, but finding my audio was cut off. This would not be an issue for a live presentation, but for a pre-recorded version like this, it is necessary to allow for these pauses - or use different transitions. 

I may or may not have deduced all of the contributing factors for Python's ascendancy, but aside from developing presentation skills, it was a great project for learning to look outward from the immediate data to help understand what insights might be gained.
