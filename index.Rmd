I've always been into numbers, technology and problem-solving, whether in bookkeeping, grant writing, social network research, music, sculpture or arts administration. 


Since 2021, I've been developing technical data skills in Python, R, SQL, Tableau and Excel -- and a little in NVivo and Power BI. This has been assisted gratefully by the Victorian Digital Jobs Program, which gave me 12 weeks training at RMIT Online, followed by a 12-week placement at KPMG in their Policy, Economics and Public Impact group, where I contributed data solutions on a range of projects for my team. 

It is an exciting time  

I've just completed my Grad Cert of Data Science at RMIT Online (June 2023), utilising Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R (RStudio).

Here you'll find examples of my projects:

- **Python** -- [data wrangling and analysis](RMIT-employee-retention.html), [visualisation, presentation and forecasting](vista-analysis.html)
- **R** -- [data wrangling and analysis](RMIT-Statistical-Data-Analysis.html), [statistical theory and methods](RMIT-Stats-and-probability-with-R.html), [machine learning, linear regression and forecasting](RMIT-AB-testing.html)
- **Shiny app** -- [interactive web app](shiny-tco-app.html) built with R
- **Tableau** -- interactive visualisations of [sales reports/forecasting](tableau.html#puri), [investment advice](tableau.html#aircom), [government cultural funding](tableau.html#govt-arts) and [Spotify metrics](tableau.html#spotify)
- **Presentation** -- examples of telling [data stories](rise-slide-of-python.html), presenting [A/B testing results](rise-slide-of-python.html) and a [text analysis](macbeth-and-mariam.html) of two 17th century plays
- **Other** -- use of SQL, Excel, Gephi and Survey Monkey for projects such as [mock](other-projects.html#puri) and [real sales dashboards](other-projects.html#excel-dashboard)), [research](other-projects.html#socialnetwork) and [advocacy](other-projects.html#jazz-survey)


And of course, this [Github-hosted](https://github.com/adam-tuoa){target="_blank"} website is an example of me working in R Markdown (and learning a little CSS along the way).
