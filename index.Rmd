Here are a few of the projects I've been doing this year.  

I'm just completed my Grad Cert of Data Science at RMIT Online, which has involved both Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R (RStudio):  
- Data Science with Python

- Data Visualisation

- Data Wrangling

- Applied Analytics  

<br>

It has been a good mix:  

- applying statistical theory and methods involving understanding distributions, linear regression, hypothesis testing.

- plenty of data wrangling using Tidy Data principles

- a text analysis of two 17th century plays, Macbeth and The Tragedie of Mariam

- creating data visualisation with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and ggplot

- building my first interactive Shiny app
