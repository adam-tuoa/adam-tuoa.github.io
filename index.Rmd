I've always been into numbers, technology and problem-solving, whether in bookkeeping, grant writing, social network research, music, sculpture or arts administration. 

Examples of data analysis in my musical exploits include 2015's _100:25:1_ project involving social network analysis, as well as in my research and advocacy for the Australian jazz scene at state and federal levels. Since undertaking further study through the Victorian Digital Jobs Program and at RMIT, I've developed presentation and technical data skills in Power BI, Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Neo4j and Excel, working in major professional service consultancies, GHD and KPMG, as well as project-based work for The Music Place, Celsius Design and University of Melbourne research.

Here you'll find examples of my projects:

- **Python** -- [data wrangling and analysis](employee-retention.html), [visualisation, presentation and forecasting](vista-analysis.html)
- **R** -- [data wrangling and analysis](statistical-data-analysis.html), [statistical theory and methods](stats-and-probability-with-r.html), [machine learning, linear regression and forecasting](ab-testing.html)
- **Power BI** -- [interactive dashboard](pbi-student-performance.html) that got me a job
- **Shiny app** -- [interactive web app](shiny-tco-app.html) built with R
- **Tableau** -- interactive visualisations of [sales reports/forecasting](tableau.html#puri), [investment advice](tableau.html#aircom), [government cultural funding](tableau.html#govt-arts) and [Spotify metrics](tableau.html#spotify)
- **ML/AI** -- machine learning for [spam classification](spam-classification.html) and a Python script to access [ChatGPT and DALL-E 2](chatgpt-dalle2.html) in Jupyter Notebook
- **Presentation** -- examples of telling [data stories](rise-slide-of-python.html), presenting [A/B testing results](ab-testing.html) and a [text analysis](macbeth-and-mariam.html) of two 17th century plays
- **Other** -- use of SQL, Excel, Gephi and Survey Monkey for projects such as [mock](other-projects.html#puri) and [real sales dashboards](other-projects.html#excel-dashboard)), [research](other-projects.html#socialnetwork) and [advocacy](other-projects.html#jazz-survey)


And of course, this [Github-hosted](https://github.com/adam-tuoa){target="_blank"} website is an example of me working in R Markdown (and learning a little CSS along the way).
