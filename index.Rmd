I've always been into numbers and problem-solving, which has been used in bookkeeping, grant writing, social network research and arts administration. Since 2021, I've been developing technical data skills in Excel, SQL, Python, R and Tableau - and a little in NVivo and Power BI.

It is an exciting and stimulating time as the tools are just getting better and better, though there's still the need for people with data literacy skills.

I've just completed my Grad Cert of Data Science at RMIT Online (June 2023), which involved Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R (RStudio) with a good smattering of PowerPoint along the way:

-   Data Science with Python

-   Data Visualisation

-   Data Wrangling

-   Applied Analytics


It has been a good mix:

-   applying statistical theory and methods involving understanding distributions, linear regression, hypothesis testing.

-   plenty of data wrangling using Tidy Data principles

-   a text analysis of two 17th century plays, Macbeth and The Tragedie of Mariam

-   creating data visualisation with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and ggplot

-   building my first interactive Shiny app
