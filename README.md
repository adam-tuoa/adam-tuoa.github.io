## Data Portfolio

Visit [adam-tuoa.github.io](http://adam-tuoa.github.io) to see examples of the data projects I have been working on and the skills I've been developing, such as:

- Python/R programming
- Power BI/Tableau/Shiny app interactive dashboards
- data analysis
- statistics
- distributions
- generating synthetic data
- hypothesis testing and verification 
- visualisations (including matplotlib and ggplot)

And the site itself has been built using R Markdown documents with RStudio - with guidance from [this Githib resource](https://resources.github.com/github-and-rstudio/), though the code for the `_site.yml` file has a couple of indents that I had to remove. Check mine for comparison or [send me a note](mailto:adam@tuoa.com.au) for advice.

Recently updated to include a Power BI report example
