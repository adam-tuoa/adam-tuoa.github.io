## Data Portfolio

Visit [adam-tuoa.github.io](http://adam-tuoa.github.io) to see examples of the data projects I have been working on and the skills I've been developing, such as:

- R programming
- data analysis
- statistics
- distributions
- generating sythetic data
- hypothesis testing and verification 
- visualisations (including ggplot)
- interactive Shiny app (built in R)

And the site itself has been built using R Markdown documents with RStudio - with guidance from [this Githib resource](https://resources.github.com/github-and-rstudio/), though the code for the `_site.yml` file has a couple of indents that I had to remove. Check mine for comparison or [send me a note](mailto:adam@tuoa.com.au) for advice.

I plan to update it soon with some Python/Jupyter Notebook projects as well as other reports, presentations, analyses and visualisations I've been up to.
